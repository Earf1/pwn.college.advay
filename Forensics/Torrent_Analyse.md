# Challenge: Torrent Analyse
- Category: Forensics

## Description
SOS, someone is torrenting on our network.
One of your colleagues has been using torrent to download some files on the companyâ€™s network. Can you identify the file(s) that were downloaded? The file name will be the flag, like picoCTF{filename}

## Flag: 
`picoCTF{ubuntu-19.10-desktop-amd64.iso}`

## Solution
On analysing the .pcap file, i find multiple protocols present, but since the challenge talks about torrents, I focus on `BT-DHT` exchanges. 
Going through these, i find multiple info-hashes with multiple sources, but since have to find out the file that was downloaded, i only focused on the info-hashes with `src=192.168.73.132`

Since, all of these hashes are the same, i looked it up on google and got the file name as `ubuntu-19.10-desktop-amd64.iso`.
